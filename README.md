XCom Modding Utility (unfinished)
=================================

It was supposed to be all-in-one console + GUI utility to analyze and modify XCOM upk and ini/loc files, but I never came to finish it.

The code is a rework of my UPKUtils project: https://github.com/wghost/UPKUtils

Analyzing part is working and can operate on uncompressed packages. Hex to pseudo-code compiler and upk patcher are not working, corresponding classes weren't reworked to support new classes structure and won't compile (so they're here just for the reference).

Documentation can be found under UPKUtils repo.
